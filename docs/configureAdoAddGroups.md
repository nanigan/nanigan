- Navigate to the Azure Active Directory Admin Portal: https://aad.portal.azure.com/
- Navigate to Azure AD Admin portal
- Select *Users*
- Select *Add user* if new user

![Create a new Azure DevOps Project](images/create-project.jpg)

---

## **CREATE AZURE DEVOPS REPO**

- Once the new project has been created, click on *Repos*
- Name the repository
- In the create the repository blade, select *Repository type*
    - Git (select this type of repository)
    - TFVC

- Navigate to the Azure DevOps portal: https://dev.azure.com
- Select *Repos -> Files*
- Click on *Clone*
- Select *Clone in VS Code*
- Select the location of where the repository will be saved locally. Recommend a location that is not a symbolic link for a directory located in OneDrive
- Once the repository has been cloned locally, select the *Open in new window* option
- Recommendation: make an edit to the *README.md* file, save, commit, and merge to your ADO repository. This will test the configuration of your repository and your local IDE

---

## **CREATE AZURE AD SECURITY PRINCIPAL AND SECRET**
A [security principal (sometimes known as an SPN)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/service-accounts-principal?msclkid=6afe3d9bca5a11ecac7b69878f4020c0) is an identity object stored in Azure Active Directory. This object and its associated secret are used by Azure DevOps to authenticate with your Azure AD tenant and can then be used as an RBAC assignment to provide access to the deployment scope (subscription, management group, resource group, etc.) of the pipeline. This step is required to create a [service connection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/service-endpoints?msclkid=4f373afdca5a11eca724c679ccfdfa9e&view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml) in Azure DevOps.


### *Create the Service Principal*

- Navigate to the Azure Active Directory Admin Portal: https://aad.portal.azure.com/
- Navigate to Azure AD Admin portal:
- Click on *App Registrations*
- Click on *New Registration*

![Create new Service Principal](images/create-spn-1.jpg)

- Click *Next*
- Name your Service Principal
- Select *Accounts in this organizational directory only- Single Tenant*

![Create new Service Principal](images/create-spn-2.jpg)

---

### *Create the Service Principal Secret*

- Click on *Certificates and Secrets*
- Click on *New client secret*
- Name the secret- recommend: a name that is descriptive so that anyone looking can get an idea of what the secret is used for
- Determine secret expiration date- recommend: no more than 24 months
- Click *add*
- Once the secret has been created, open Notepad (or any text editor) and copy the secret value to that file. **The secret will only be shown when created.**
- Also copy the following values from that Service Principal's instance in the AAD admin portal:
    - ClientID (this is also sometimes referred to the application ID)
    - Tenant ID
    - Subscription ID
    - Client secret- captured in the previous step

![Create the Service Principal Secret](images/create-secret-1.jpg)

**Make sure to copy client secret when it is created; it won't be shown once you navigate from that secrets blade**

---

## **CREATE SERVICE CONNECTION**

- Navigate to the Azure DevOps portal: https://dev.azure.com
- Navigate to your Azure DevOps project
- Within the *Pipelines* section of the settings blade, select *Service Connections*
- Select *Create a Service Connection*
- Select *Azure Resource Manager*
- Select *Next*
- For the purposes of this tutorial, select *Service Principal (manual)
    - Recommendation: utilize the *Service Principal (automatic) when you are both an owner in the target scope and a project administrator
- The next screen is where you'll use the service principal details you copied to your notepad when you created it in an earlier step
    - Environment: *Azure Cloud*
    - Select Scope Level
        - For the purposes of this tutorial, we will use *Subscription* as the Scope of our deployment
    - Enter subscription ID
    - Enter subscription name
    - In the authentication section:
        - Service Principal ID. Enter the GUID value you copied when the service principal was created
        - Credential: *Service Principal Key*
            - Recommendation: if using *Service Principal (manual) you should leverage *Certificate* as the credential type as it is a more secure configuration. This is in a PEM format that includes both the certificate and private key content
    - Tenant ID: enter Tenant ID GUID copied when the service principal was created
    - Click *Verify* to confirm the connection was successfully established
    - Provide your service connection a name
        - Recommendation is to use a name that describes as best as possible the SPN's intended use
    - (Optional) Provide a description for the service connection 
    - In the *Security* section, uncheck the *Grant access permission to all pipelines*

![Create the Service Principal Secret](images/create-service-connection.jpg)

## **GRANT SPN ACCESS TO AZURE**

- Navigate to the Azure Portal: https://portal.azure.com
- In the search bar, type: *subscriptions*
- Select your target subscription
- Select *IAM and Access Control*
- Under roles, select [*Contributor*](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles?msclkid=cde23ebbca6011ec9084ff2568100df9#contributor)
    - This is least privileged role to create the resources needed in Azure
- At the conclusion of this step, you'll have an identity object that's been assigned the contributor role in the target subscription. 

---

## **ASSIGN AAD GROUPS PERMISSIONS IN AZURE DEVOPS**

- [Add an Azure AD group to an Azure DevOps group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/manage-azure-active-directory-groups)
- Must enable preview feature [Organization Permissions Settings Page v2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/project/navigation/preview-features?view=azure-devops)
